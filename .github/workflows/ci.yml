# This sets up the page shown at [1]--continuous integration via
# GitHub's Actions[2]. Feel free to add particular environments you
# feel worthy of testing and proving useful in addition to those from
# CPAN Testers, but let's keep in mind that, unlike GitHub, CPAN
# Testers is a community effort and probably valuable as a way to
# remain independent from big companies. And please let's make sure
# that nobody *has* to use GitHub to contribute to the project or
# becomes a second class contributor if they refuse to use it.
