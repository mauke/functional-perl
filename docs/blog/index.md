# The Functional Perl blog

Articles, just like all pages on this website, can be edited via the
'edit' link near the top right of each page. You can also send
[me](mailto:ch@christianjaeger.ch) your change by email. If you've got
any comments, please just send them to me by
[email](mailto:ch@christianjaeger.ch) until I've added proper
commenting functionality. If you indicate that it's for the public,
I'll post it here, with your first name and initial of the last name
but I won't post your mail address.
