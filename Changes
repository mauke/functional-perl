0.72.11 2019-11-26
    - reimplement repl+ in Perl for Windows
    - clean up tail expansion dependencies during testing, hopefully
      fixes test failures when run out of alphabetic order
    - fix for #131081 (t/skip-leak.t fails on BSD systems)
    - change Chj::TEST to use TAP so that subtest failure details can
      be seen in CPAN tester reports

    - fix #131073 (Can't exec /bin/bash at website/gen line 1.)

    - more curing of unnecessary loading of FP::Repl
    - FunctionalPerl: do not die on module load errors
    - Chj::TEST::run_tests returns an object now with success number
      as well; can't manage to merge numbers with Test::More's though.
    - fix test.pl deletion: re-introduce $ENV{TEST}=1
    - move csvstreams.t to t-slow/ (will look into how to do this
      properly later)

0.72.9 2019-11-24
    - fix handling of autobox dependency (both making it optional in
      tests as well as making it a hard dependency for now)
    - hopefully fix "Bug #131047 for FunctionalPerl: Some tests run
      with the wrong perl"
    - do not use tail-expanded files from meta/ in t/pod-snippets.t
