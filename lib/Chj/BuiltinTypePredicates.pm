    # NOTE: never returns true for strings, even though plain strings
    # naming globals containing filehandles in their IO slot will work
    # for IO, too! Let's just leave that depreciated and
    # 'non-working', ok?

    # NOTE 2: also this only returns true for *references* to globs,
    # not globs themselves (which could also be used as in
    # `(*STDOUT)->print( "Huh\n")`). Let's just leave bare globs as
    # buckets for any of the variable types perl has, and not assume
    # it's meant to be a filehandle, ok? (Or is that inconsistent with
    # treating `\*STDOUT` as filehandle? But there's no way around
    # this one, as that's what `open my $out, ..` gives, and we do
    # check that the IO slot is actually set in this case.) (hm could
    # take reference to the bare glob and treat it the same then,
    # though; but still.)

    if (defined(my $rt = reftype($v))) {
        (($rt eq "GLOB" and *{$v}{IO}) or $rt eq "IO") ? 1 : '';
